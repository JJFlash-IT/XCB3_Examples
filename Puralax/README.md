Puralax!
========
A full-feature game with 25 playable levels written in **XC=BASIC**.

This is the port of the game found on [http://www.puralax.com/](http://www.puralax.com/), although only the first 25 levels have been implemented. It is very easy to add more levels, but I unfortunately don't have time for it.

The program demonstrates some key features of the language, such as:

- Procedural programming
- Recursion
- Inclusion of binary files
- String & memory functions
- Speed optimization

Enjoy!
