# More example programs for XCB3 !
A quest to port as many XC-Basic v2 example programs as possible to XC-Basic v3.1.

[XC-Basic](https://xc-basic.net/) is a modern cross-compiler for various Commodore systems. Version 2 had quite a few interesting example programs which Version 3 lacks, so I'm trying to recover those "old" programs so they work in the current version.
